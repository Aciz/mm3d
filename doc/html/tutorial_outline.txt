   Cylinder, 4 segments, six sides
   Have to rotate (hold shift) to get it vertical
   select vertices and scale to chest size
   move vertices to match drawing
   Adjust dimensions in other viewports (but only adjust on the depth axis)
   edge turn at waist  ###detailadjustments
      see problem edge, highlight
      select edge turn
      see corrected faces
   edge divide to add detail
   snap to vertex
      see also drag vertex
   hide
      back faces are getting in the 
      select, hide selected
   edge turn
      All down the side (single before and after picture)
   unhide
   Mirror
      Use boolean operation to cut it half
      Torso is object A
      Cube is object B
      Subtract B from A
      Simplify mesh
      Duplicate
         (note vertex count)
      Flip
      Select center vertices
      weld
         (note vertex count)

      <h2>Help! What should I read first!?</h2>

      <p>
      If you are new to Misfit Model 3D, this page and the 
      <a href="olh_use.html">Using Misfit Model</a> page will be the most useful 
      guides to getting started with Misfit Model.  This introduction page is a 
      basic roadmap
      that explains how to get around in Misfit Model.  The <b>Using Misfit Model</b> 
      page will help you get started on creating models.  The rest of
      the documentation is reference material that discusses specific features
      in more detail.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Note:</b> This documentation is in the process of being updated for
      Version 1.4. Some documentation may still refer to older versions of
      the software.
      </p>

      <a name="intro"></a>
      <h2>Misfit Model 3D Introduction</h2>

      <p>
      Misfit Model 3D is an application that allows users to create and modify
      triangle based models.  It currently supports a variety of 3D vertex
      manipulation tools as well as texturing and animations.
      There is a plugin system
      so that extensions can be written to provide more tools, commands, or
      model import and export filters.  
      </p>

      <p>
      This overview should give you a basic understanding of how to get around
      Misfit Model 3D and teach you terminology that will be useful in other sections of
      the documentation.  Once you have finished this section and are familiar
      with the Misfit Model's layout, you will probably
      want to look at the <a href="olh_use.html">Using Misfit Model</a> section to 
      get tips on how to effectively create models.
      </p>

      <p>
      Currently Misfit Model 3D has its own file format, but can also export 
      models in the Quake MD2 and MD3, Milkshape 3D, COB, DXF, and OBJ file 
      formats.  Other
      formats are planned for the future and may be added as plugins.
      <!-- FIXME Cal3d? -->
      </p>

      <p>
      When you start Misfit Model 3D you will see the <b>Main Window</b>.    
      The Main Window has a set of viewports
      that act as a canvas for model manipulation and a tool bar that provides 
      interactive model manipulation features.  There can be multiple
      Main Windows, one for each model that is open.
      </p>

      <a name="mainwindow"></a>
      <h2>Main Window</h2>

      <p>
      The <b>Main Window</b> is where you modify a model.  The Main
      Window has a menu bar, a tool bar, a status bar, and a number of 
      viewports that let
      you see the model from various directions.
      There are also several dockable windows that are hidden by default.
      The <a href="olh_properties.html">Properties Panel</a>
      in particular can be very useful.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Main Window</b> has a menu bar that allows you to operate on the
      model in the window's viewports as well as creating new models and opening
      existing models.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The <b>Toolbar</b> has a set of tool buttons.  The tool buttons
      select tools that allow you to manipulate a model interactively.
      For example, you can select the &quot;Draw Cube&quot; tool
      and then click and drag the mouse in a viewport to create a cube.
      Each of the tools in the toolbar is also available in the Main Window's
      <b>Tools</b> menu.
      </p>

      <p>
      There are two types of tools in the toolbar: Creation tools and 
      manipulation tools.  Creation tools create new vertices and faces interactively
      in various shapes such as cubes and spheres.  Manipulation tools
      allow you to interactively change faces and vertices that already exist.  
      Manipulation tools include moving, scaling, and rotation tools.
      Manipulation tools only operate on vertices or faces that have been selected
      with the "Select" tool.  
      </p>
      
      <p>It is important to note that faces often share
      vertices.  Unselected faces may be modified by changes to vertices that
      are also part of a selected face.  To disconnect faces from each other
      so that they do not share vertices, use the <b>Unweld vertices</b> command.
      </p>

      <p>
      Some tools have additional options, which appear in an a separate
      toolbar.  For example, the sphere tool has an option that specifies
      how many triangles the sphere will be composed of.
      </p>

      <p>  The menu bar has several menus that provide other functions to
      modify or create a model. See the
      <a href="olh_mainwin.html#menubar">Menu&nbsp;Bar</a> documentation
      for more complete documentation.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>View</b> menu allows you to change the number and layout of the
      viewports in the view window (you may have 1, 2, 4, 6, or 9 viewports).
      You can force the viewports to show the whole model or selected
      region by selecing either the <b>Frame All</b> or <b>Frame Selected</b> options,
      respectively.
      You can select how to display the model in the othographic (canvas)
      and perspective viewports based on four options.
      </p>

      <ul>
         <li> Wireframe - Shows the model as an outline of all faces. </li>
         <li> Flat - Shows the model as a set of flat polygons (with lighting). </li>
         <li> Smooth - Shows the model as a set of smoothed polygons (vertex normals
            are averaged between all polygons that share them; with lighting). </li>
         <li> Texture - Shows the model as a set of smoothed, lit polygons with
            textures applied. </li>
         <li> Alpha Blend - Shows the model as a set of smoothed, lit polygons with
            alpha blended (transparent) textures applied. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      There are also some rendering options in the <b>Render Options</b> View submenu.
      These options include
      how bone joints are displayed, whether or not texture projections objects
      are visible, how missing textures are rendered, whether polygon edges (3d lines)
      are displayed in the perspective views, and whether or not back-facing polygons
      are drawn. The <a href="olh_mainwin.html#menubar">Menu&nbsp;Bar</a>
      documentation has more details.
      </p>

      <p>
      The status bar contains text (on the left side) that describes the results of 
      recent operations on the model.  On the right side it shows you how many vertices,
      faces, groups, bone joints, points, and materials exist in the current model.
      If you have any vertices,
      faces, bone joints, or points selected
      the count will be shown with the selected separated from the
      total with a slash ('/').
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Viewports</b> in the center of the Main Window are where you 
      view and modify a model.  There are two types of viewport views:
      <b>Perspective Views</b> and <b>Orthographic Views</b>.
      In this documentation orthographic views are sometimes called 
      canvas views because those are the views in which you can use tools 
      to change the model (like a drawing canvas in a 2D paint program).
      The view type and direction is indicated
      in a combo box above the viewport on the left.  The field of view is
      indicated in a text entry box above the viewport to the right of the
      view direction.  Larger numbers mean you can see more of the model canvas (think
      of the opposite of zoom).  Three short colored lines indicate the origin.
      Each color extends in the positive direction along an axis.  The red line
      extends along the X axis, the green line extends along the Y axis, and the blue
      line extends along the Z axis.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can scroll the active viewport by clicking on the arrows in the upper-right
      corner.  The four-way arrow allows you to click
      and drag the viewport.  You can also use the middle mouse button to drag the viewport.
      You can zoom in and out by using the magnifying glass buttons above the viewport
      scroll buttons.
      </p>

      <p>
      The view type and direction can be changed to see the model from various
      angles.  In the <b>Perspective View</b> near portions of the
      model appear larger, far portions of the model appear smaller.  The 
      Perspective View
      may also have visible lighting and texture effects.  This view only allows
      you to view the model.  You cannot modify the model from a viewport in
      Perspective mode.
      </p>

      <p>
      By left-clicking and dragging your mouse pointer you can rotate the
      perspective view
      along the horizontal axis or vertical axis.  By middle-clicking and
      dragging you can move the viewport left, right, up, and down.  Using the
      scroll wheel will zoom in or out.  The
      right mouse button has no effect in the Perspective View.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Orthographic Views</b> show the model from one of six directions:
      Front, Back, Left, Right, Top, or Bottom.  These views are a CAD-like
      projection of the model from the specified direction.  These views are
      not modified by perspective.  Two cubes of equal size will always appear
      the same size in this view regardless of how "far" they are from the
      viewing plane.  Each of the six orthographic views is a canvas view, where 
      you can create and manipulate model vertices and faces.  The othrographic
      viewports may also render the model as a wireframe, solid-flat polygons,
      solid-smooth polygons, or textured polygons.
      </p>

      <p>
      An orthographic viewport can be rotated by holding the Ctrl button
      and click-dragging with the left mouse button.
      <!-- FIXME note keyboard shortcut for toggling ortho/persp -->
      </p>

      <p>
      The effect of the left and right mouse buttons depends on the tool that is
      currently selected.  The left mouse button is the main tool button and
      the right button is an alternate button.  For example, using the
      select tool you can select vertices and faces with the left mouse button
      and unselect them with the right mouse button.
      By middle-clicking and dragging you can drag the viewport left, right, 
      up, and down.  Using the scroll wheel will zoom in or out.
      </p>

      <p>
      The active viewport (the viewport under the mouse) 
      will have a slightly lighter background color
      than the others.  Some keyboard shortcuts will modify the selected
      viewport.  For example + and - will zoom in and out.  0 (zero) will
      center the viewport on the origin.  The backtick (left quote) will
      flip an orthographic view to the opposite side (front view will become
      a back view).
      </p>

      <p>

      <h1>View Window</h1>

      <p>
      The <b>View Window</b> is the main Misfit Model 3D window.
      It allows you to modify a model.  The View
      Window has a menu bar, a tool bar, a status bar, and a number of 
      viewports that let
      you see the model from various directions.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>View Window</b> has a menu bar that allows you to operate on the
      model in the window's viewports as well as creating new models and opening
      existing models.
      The specific contents of these menus
      may change based on installed plugins.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The <b>Toolbar</b> has a set of tool buttons.  The tool buttons
      select tools that allow you to manipulate a model interactively.
      For example, you can select the &quot;Create Cube&quot; tool
      and then click and drag the mouse in a viewport to create a cube.
      </p>

      <p>
      There are two types of tools in the toolbar: Creation tools and 
      manipulation tools.  Creation tools create new vertices and faces interactively
      in various shapes such as cubes and spheres.  Manipulation tools
      allow you to interactively change faces and vertices that already exist.  
      Manipulation tools include moving, scaling, and rotation tools.  Typically
      manipulation tools only operate on vertices or faces that have been selected
      with the "Select" tool.  
      </p>
      
      <p>It is important to note that faces often share
      vertices.  Unselected faces may be modified by changes to vertices that
      are also part of a selected face.  To disconnect faces from each other
      so that they do not share vertices, see the <b>Unweld vertices</b> command.
      </p>

      <p>
      Some tools have additional options, which appear in a separate
      toolbar.  For example, the sphere tool has an option that specifies
      how many triangles the sphere will be composed of.
      </p>

      <p>  The menu bar has several menus that provide other functions to
      modify or create a model.
      In addition to opening and
      saving models, the <b>File</b> menu also allows
      you to run scripts, merge two model files, and view available plugins.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>View</b> menu allows you to change the number and layout of the
      viewports in the view window (you may have 1, 2, 4, 6, or 9 viewports).
      You can force the viewports to show the whole model or selected
      region by selecing either the <b>Frame All</b> or <b>Frame Selected</b> options,
      respectively.
      You can select how to display the model in the othographic and 3D perspective
      viewports based on four options.
      </p>

      <ul>
         <li> Wireframe - Shows the model as an outline of all faces.
         <li> Flat - Shows the model as a set of flat polygons (with lighting).
         <li> Smooth - Shows the model as a set of smoothed polygons (vertex normals
            are averaged between all polygons that share them; with lighting).
         <li> Texture - Shows the model as a set of smoothed, lit polygons with
            textures applied.
         <li> Alpha Blend - Shows the model as a set of smoothed, lit polygons with
            alpha blended (transparent) textures applied.
      </ul>

      <p>
      You can also choose how you want bone joints to be displayed (as bones,
      lines, or hidden) and how you want unloadable textures to be rendered (untextured
      polygons, or polygons textured with a black 'X' on a red background).
      Use the Render/Hide 3D Selection option to indicate if you want your selection 
      to be visible in the 3D view.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Tools</b> menu lists all the available tools.
      It also includes the <b>Undo</b> and <b>Redo</b> options.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Primtives</b> menu lists non-interactive operations that modify
      vertices or faces.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Groups</b> menu lists non-interactive operations that modify
      groups, including texturing.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Animations</b> menu provides functions to manipulate model animations.
      There are interactive and non-interactive functions provided by this menu.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Help</b> menu brings you to this ridiculously helpful documentation.
      </p>

      <p>
      The status bar contains text (on the left side) that describes the results of 
      recent operations on the model.  On the right side it shows you how many vertices,
      faces, groups, and materials exist in the current model.  If you have any vertices,
      faces, or bone joints selected the count will be shown with the selected separated from the
      total with a slash ('/').
      </p>


      <p>
      The <b>Viewports</b> in the center of the View Window are where you 
      view and modify a model.  There are two types of viewport views: <b>3D View</b>
      and <b>Orthographic Views</b>.  The view type and direction is indicated
      in a combo box above the viewport on the left.  The field of view is
      indicated in a text entry box above the viewport to the right of the
      view direction.  Larger numbers mean you can see more of the model canvas (think
      of the opposite of zoom).  Three short colored lines indicate the origin.
      Each color extends in the positive direction along an axis.  The red line
      extends along the X axis, the green line extends along the Y axis, and the blue
      line extends along the Z axis.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can scroll the active viewport by clicking on the arrows in the upper-right
      corner.  The four-way arrow allows you to click
      and drag the viewport.  You can also use the middle mouse button to drag the viewport.
      You can zoom in and out by using the magnifying glass buttons above the viewport
      scroll buttons.
      </p>

      <p>
      The view type and direction can be changed to see the model from various
      angles.  The <b>3D View</b> is a perspective view.  Near portions of the
      model appear larger, far portions of the model appear smaller.  The 3D View
      may also have visible lighting and texture effects.  This view only allows
      you to view the model.  You cannot modify the model from a viewport in
      3D mode.
      </p>

      <p>
      By left-clicking and dragging your mouse pointer you can rotate the 3D view
      along the horizontal axis or vertical axis.  By middle-clicking and
      dragging you can move the viewport left, right, up, and down.  Using the
      scroll wheel will zoom in or out.  The
      right mouse button has no effect in the 3D View.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Orthographic Views</b> show the model from one of six directions:
      Front, Back, Left, Right, Top, or Bottom.  These views are a CAD-like
      projection of the model from the specified direction.  These views are
      not modified by perspective.  Two cubes of equal size will always appear
      the same size in this view regardless of how "far" they are from the
      viewing plane.  Each of the six orthographic views is a canvas view, where 
      you can create and manipulate model vertices and faces.  The othrographic
      viewports may also render the model as a wireframe, solid-flat polygons,
      solid-smooth polygons, or textured polygons.
      </p>

      <p>
      The effect of the left and right mouse buttons depends on the tool that is
      currently selected.  The left mouse button is the main tool button and
      the right button is an alternate button.  For example, using the
      select tool you can select vertices and faces with the left mouse button
      and unselect them with the right mouse button.
      By middle-clicking and dragging you can drag the viewport left, right, 
      up, and down.  Using the scroll wheel will zoom in or out.
      </p>

      <p>
      The active viewport (the viewport under the mouse) 
      will have a slightly lighter background color
      than the others.  Some keyboard shortcuts will modify the selected
      viewport.  For example + and - will zoom in and out.  0 (zero) will
      center the viewport on the origin.  The backtick (left quote) will
      flip an orthographic view to the opposite side (front view will become
      a back view).
      </p>

      <p>
      There are two modes for the view window.  The default one is the
      <b>Model Edit Mode</b>.  This is the mode you are in when you start
      Misfit Model 3D and are viewing a model.  In this mode changes you make
      affect the position of polygons and bone joints.
      The other mode is
      <b>Animation Mode</b>.  This mode is active when you have the 
      <b>Animation Mode Window</b> open.  In this mode changes you make affect
      the current animation frame.
      </p>

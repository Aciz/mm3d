      <h1>Animation Mode Window</h1>

      <h2> Overview </h2>

      <p>
      The <b>Animation Mode Window</b> allows you to create animations and
      animate models.  You can change frame counts and frame rates as well as
      set skeletal keyframes or frame vertex positions.  You can also
      play animations from this window. For performance reasons animation
      playback is only rendered in perspective viewports.
      </p>

      <p>
      While the <b>Animation Mode Window</b> is open you can use the view
      window's toolbar to manipulate the model in animation mode.  Most
      selection and manipulation tools work the same as they do in model
      edit mode, though some (such as the rotate tool in skeletal animation
      mode) will behave differently.
      </p>

      <p>
      The behavior of various tools in animation mode is described in
      the <a href="olh_tools.html">Tools</a> documentation.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Animation Mode Window</b> has two tabs, one for <b>Skeletal</b>
      animations and one for <b>Frame</b> animations.  The combo box in
      the tab page will list all of the animations of the animation type
      for the tab you have selected.  All operations (with the exception of
      the <b>New</b> button) operate on the animation that is named in
      the combo box.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can use the frame slider to select the animation frame that you want
      to view or edit.  All viewports on the view window will display the
      frame of the model you have selected.  
      </p>

      <p>
      You can use the selection tools to select vertices for <b>Frame</b>
      animations or bone joints for <b>Skeletal</b> animations.  You
      can use the move or rotate tool to change the position or orientation
      of selected primitives.
      </p>

      <p>
      In <b>Skeletal</b> animation mode the rotate tool works differently than
      it does in standard edit mode.  The rotation only applies to one bone
      joint, and the rotation is always centered on the joint.  In other words,
      you are rotating the bone joint itself, not the position of the bone joint.
      In <b>Skeletal</b> animation mode, the delete command also behaves differently.
      The delete command will delete any translation or rotation keyframes for
      all the selected joints in the current frame.  Keyframes in other animation
      frames will not be affected.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can use <b>Undo</b> and <b>Redo</b> from the <b>Animation Mode Window</b>
      just as you would in the standard model edit mode.  You can select
      <b>Undo</b> and <b>Redo</b> from the menu on the <b>Main Window</b>, or use
      Ctrl-Z and Ctrl-Y from either the <b>Animation Mode Window</b> or the
      <b>Main Window</b>.
      </p>

      document.

      <h2> Animation Operations </h2>

      <h3> New </h3>

      <p>
      The <b>New</b> button creates a new animation.  It will prompt you for an
      animation name.  The new animation will be a skeletal or frame animation
      depending on the animation type tab you are working on.
      </p>

      <h3> Rename </h3>

      <p>
      The <b>Rename</b> button change the name of the selected animation.  
      It will prompt you for a new animation name.
      </p>

      <h3> Delete </h3>

      <p>
      The <b>Delete</b> button will delete the current animation.
      </p>

      <h3> Frames Spin Box </h3>

      <p>
      The <b>Frames Spin Box</b> will change the frame count of the current
      animation.  You can use the up and down arrows, or type the number directly
      in the box.
      </p>

      <h3> FPS Text Box </h3>

      <p>
      The <b>FPS Text Box</b> will change the frame rate of the current animation.
      </p>

      <h3> Frame Slider </h3>

      <p>
      The <b>Frame Slider </b> will change the current frame of the current animation.
      You can use this to edit the model position for any frame in the animation.
      The <b>Copy Frame</b>, <b>Paste Frame</b>, and <b>Clear Frame</b> buttons
      also operate on the current frame.
      </p>

      <h3> Copy Frame </h3>

      <p>
      The <b>Copy Frame</b> button saves the position of the model primitives in
      the current frame of the animation.  You can then select another frame 
      or animation and use the <b>Paste Frame</b> button to copy the position
      and orientation of the model primitives to a different animation frame.
      </p>

      <p>
      For skeletal animations only joints that have keyframes set are copied and
      pasted.  Any joints that have keyframes set in the target frame will not
      be affected if the source frame did not have a keyframe for that joint.
      If this is not desired behavior, you can use <b>Clear Frame</b> on the
      target frame before using <b>Paste Frame</b>.
      </p>

      <h3> Paste Frame </h3>

      <p>
      The <b>Paste Frame</b> button takes the animation data saved from one animation
      frame by the <b>Copy Frame</b> button and copies it into the current 
      animation frame.
      </p>

      <p>
      For skeletal animations only joints that have keyframes set are copied and
      pasted.  Any joints that have keyframes set in the target frame will not
      be affected if the source frame did not have a keyframe for that joint.
      If this is not desired behavior, you can use <b>Clear Frame</b> on the
      target frame before using <b>Paste Frame</b>.
      </p>

      <h3> Clear Frame </h3>

      <p>
      The <b>Clear Frame</b> button clears all position information for the
      current animation frame.  All model primitives will be restored to the
      same position they occupy in model edit mode.  In the case of a skeletal
      animation it deletes keyframes for this frame.  In this case joints
      will be interpolated between the keyframes in previous frames and the
      keyframes in following frames.
      </p>

      <h3> Play / Pause </h3>

      <p>
      The <b>Play</b> button runs the current animation at its specified
      frame rate.  The <b>Play</b> button becomes a <b>Pause</b> during
      playback so that you can pause an animation and resume it later.
      Paused animations resume from the time at which they were paused.
      </p>

      <p>
      Use the <b>Stop</b> button to stop an animation completely.
      Use the <b>Loop Checkbox</b> to control whether the animation should
      start from the beginning again when it completes.
      </p>

      <p>
      Animation playback is only rendered in perspective viewports.
      Orthographic viewports will not animate.  This is for performance
      reasons, and may become a configurable option at a later time.
      </p>

      <h3> Stop </h3>

      <p>
      The <b>Stop</b> button will stop a running animation.  An animation
      that is stoped and then played again will play starting from the 
      first frame.
      </p>

      <h3> Loop Checkbox </h3>

      <p>
      The <b>Loop Checkbox</b> controls whether the animations loops when it
      completes or not.  If the animation completes and the <b>Loop Checkbox</b>
      is checked, the animation will restart from the first frame.  If the animation
      completes and the <b>Loop Checkbox</b> is not checked, the animation
      will stop.
      </p>

      <p>
      If you have <b>loop</b> checked, skeletal animation keyframe interpolation
      will wrap to the first frame.  This interpolation begins on the last keyframe set
      for a given joint and ends on the first keyframe for that join.  
      If you have an animation with 10 frames and a rotation keyframe
      on Joint A for frames 1 and 10, then the animation will interpolate
      from 1 to 10, and then from 10 to 1.  If Joint B has keyframes in frames 3 and 7, 
      it will interpolate from 3 to 7, and then again from 7 to 3.
      </p>

      <h3> Close </h3>

      <p>
      The <b>Close</b> button will close the <b>Animation Mode</b> window.
      </p>

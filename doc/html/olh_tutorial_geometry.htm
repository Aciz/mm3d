      <h2>Getting Started</h2>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
      This tutorial will demonstrate how to use Misfit Model 3D. The example
      model will be a humanoid character with texture maps and animations.
      The model will be aimed at an eventual MD3 export, because this
      demonstrates nearly all of Misfit Model 3D's capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
      Note that I am not an artist--neither 2D nor 3D, so my 3D model
      creation skills are somewhat limited. This fact should be obvious
      by the time you see the finished model. Also note that I am taking
      some short-cuts in the interest of producing this tutorial more
      quickly. There are several places where spending more time on
      detail would provide better results; but my goal was to finish
      this document rather than perform my best at 3D art.
      </p>

      <h3>Meta Data</h3>
      <p>
      The first thing I'm going to do is open up the
      <a href="olh_metawin.html">Model Meta Data Window</a> from the
      Model menu. The Meta Data Window allows you to enter some
      non-rendered information about the model. In this case I'm just
      going to note my own name in a copyright string by clicking "New",
      then double-clicking on the row to edit the key and value.
      </p>

      <p>
      In this instance the meta data is entirely optional. You can enter
      any sort of information you want in this window, or leave it completely
      empty. In some cases, meta data is used by import or export filters
      to track format-specific data that Misfit Model 3D's model class
      doesn't understand (for example, skin path information in MD3).
      </p>

      <h3>Background Images</h3>
      <p>
      Next I'm going to add a
      <a href="olh_backgroundimagedetails.html">background image</a> to my
      forward-facing viewport to aid in constructing the humanoid model. In
      this case I'll be using DaVinci's &quot;Proportions&quot;. Often you'll
      want to use a reference object with images from multiple angles so you
      can get a better sense of width and depth. In this case I'm using this as
      a reference to avoid copyright issues.
      </p>

      <p>
      The model is not intended to look exactly like DaVinci's work, it's
      just a rough guide. Also, the model will not be anotomically correct.
      :-)  <!-- FIXME does that smiley look dumb in a browser? Probably -->
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The background image window has a tab for each viewport direction.
      In my case, I'm just selecting the Forward tab and selecting
      an image file.
      </p>

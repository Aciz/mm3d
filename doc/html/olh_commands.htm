      <a name="undo">
      <h1>Undo</h1>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <b>Undo</b> reverses the last operation (if available).  The last operation could
      be the last use of the mouse on a model canvas, the last requested command 
      (except in the case of undo or redo), or a set of changes within one dialog
      box.  
      </p>

      <p>
      Undo can be used multiple times.  The number of undo items available is limited
      by memory.
      </p>

      <h3>Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
      <ul>
         <li> <b>Ctrl-Z</b> - Undo

      <a name="redo">
      <h1>Redo</h1>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <b>Redo</b> reverses the effects of undo (if the preceeding operations where undo
      commands).  Redo can be used multiple times.
      </p>

      <a name="invsel">
      <h1>Invert Selection</h1>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <b>Invert Selection</b> will select unselected portions of the model,
      and unselect selected portions of the model according to the current selection
      mode.
      </p>

      <p>
      If you are in group selection mode, ungrouped faces are ignored and will
      never be selected.

      <a name="hide">
      <h1>Hide</h1>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <b>Hide</b> will make faces or vertices of your choice invisible.  This can be
      useful if some faces are blocking your view of the part of the model with which
      you are working.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can hide the selected portion of the model or the unselected portion of the
      model.  When you are ready to see the complete model again you can select
      <b>Unhide all</b> to make the invisible portions visible again.
      <p>

      <p>
      Hidden model portions cannot be selected.  Any commands or tools which operate 
      on selected portions of the model will not modify hidden model objects.
      </p>

      <h3>Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
      <ul>
         <li> <b>H</b> - Hide unselected
         <li> <b>Shift-H</b> - Hide selected

      </ul>

      <a name="delete">
      <h1>Delete</h1>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <b>Delete</b> removes selected vertices, faces, and bone joints.  
      If a vertex is removed, any
      faces which rely on that vertex will also be deleted.  If a face is deleted
      which shares vertices with other faces, the vertices and unselected faces
      will not be deleted.  If a bone joint is deleted it will delete keyframes
      for that bone joint and may cause animation problems for children of the
      deleted joint.
      </p>

      <p>
      Delete can be used in <b>Animation Mode</b> to delete a skeletal animation keyframe
      for selected bone joints.
      </p>

      <a name="duplicate">
      <h1>Duplicate</h1>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <b>Duplicate</b> creates a copy of the current selection.  The old selection
      is unselected and the new faces will be selected for further manipulation.
      This is similar to a combined Copy/Paste action.
      </p>

      <a name="copy">
      <h1>Copy Selected to Clipboard</h1>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <b>Copy Selected</b> will copy all selected faces (along with groups and textures) 
      into an internal clipboard.  This selection can then be merged with another
      model using the <b>Paste</b> command.
      </p>

      <h3>Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
      <ul>
      <li> <b>Ctrl-C</b> - Copy selection
      </ul>

      <a name="paste">
      <h1>Paste from Clipboard</h1>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <b>Paste</b> will merge the selected portion from a previous <b>Copy</b> command
      into the current model.

      <a name="flip">
      <h1>Flip</h1>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <b>Flip</b> will move selected vertices and faces so that they
      face a different direction.  You can flip in the X, Y, or Z directions.
      For example, a <b>Flip X</b> would cause the selected part of the model 
      to change to its mirror image from the front or back canvas view (the actual
      model is affected, not just the view).
      </p>

      <a name="flatten">
      <h1>Flatten</h1>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <b>Flatten</b> will move selected vertices so that they
      share the same coordinate along a specific axis.  You can flatten in the X, Y, or Z dimensions.
      For example, a <b>Flatten X</b> would cause the selected vertices to all
      have the same X coordinate.
      </p>

      <a name="extrude">
      <h1>Extrude</h1>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <b>Extrude</b> takes faces that you have selected
      and extends them in a direction you specify.  When those faces are extended,
      each edge becomes another face which is connected to the faces' original locations.
      </p>

      <p>
      Use the X, Y, and Z text entry boxes to specify how far faces
      should be offset from their current location.  If the &quot;Make Back Faces&quot;
      option is checked new polygons will be created where the old ones were, but
      facing the opposite direction (the extruded area will be completely enclosed
      by the extrusion).
      </p>

      <a name="invnorm">
      <h1>Invert Normals</h1>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <b>Invert Normals</b> will cause normals to extend from the opposite plane of
      selected faces.  This is useful if some sections of the model have been
      manipulated in such a way that polygons are facing the wrong direction.
      </p>

      <p>
      If you have very dark polygon faces or if some polygon faces don't
      show up in a different rendering engine, it may be because your normals
      are facing the wrong direction.  In these cases, inverting normals will
      fix the problem.
      </p>

      <a name="weld">
      <h1>Weld Vertices</h1>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <b>Weld Vertices</b> will join selected vertices into one vertex.
      The vertices must be very close to each other.
      </p>

      <p>
      More than one set of vertices can be welded at one time. 
      If you have a model which has been duplicated and flipped you can weld the
      seam between the two portions by moving the seams together, selecting all
      vertices along the seam, and using a single weld command.  Only vertices
      near each other will be welded so that you can weld the entire seam in
      one operation.
      </p>

      <p>
      Vertices can be disconnected again by using the unweld command.
      </p>

      <h1>Unweld Vertices</h1>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <b>Unweld Vertices</b> will create a separate vertex for each face
      which uses a vertex.
      </p>

      <p>
      Vertices can be reconnected by using the weld command.

      <a name="snap">
      <h1>Snap Vertices Together</h1>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <b>Snap Vertices Together</b> will join a set of selected vertices
      and optionally weld them together.  This command has four different 
      behavaiors:
      </p>

      <ul>
      <li> Snap All Selected - All selected vertices snap to the same location, they remain separate vertices </li>
      <li> Snap Nearest Selected - Every two closest selected vertices snap to the same location, they remain separate vertices </li>
      <li> Snap All and Weld - All selected vertices snap to the same location, all vertices are welded into one </li>
      <li> Snap Nearest and Weld - Every two closest selected vertices snap to the same location, each pair of vertices is welded into one vertex</li>
      </ul>

      <a name="rotatetex">
      <h1>Rotate Texture Coordinates</h1>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <b>Rotate Texture Coordinates</b> allows you to rotate the texture coordinates
      of a face or group of faces.  If you use the <b>Face</b> version, the texture coordinates are
      rotated among each vertex of each selected face.  If you use the <b>Group</b> version, the
      texture coordinates are rotated 90 degrees around the center of the material texture.
      </p>

      <h1>Align Selected</h1>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <b>Align Selected</b> opens a window to move the selected
      portion of the model so that the minimum, maximum, or center values 
      of a given coordinate axis
      are aligned along a specified value of the axis.  For example,
      if you have a cube you can use the <b>Align Selection</b> window
      to align the left or right (minimum or maximum, respectively) side of 
      the cube with the axis (0.0) or any other value for X.  The shape
      of the selected portion of the model remains unchanged.

      <h1>Using Misfit Model 3D</h1>

      <p>
      This is a general guide on how to create models using Misfit.  If you have
      not already read the <a href="olh_index.html#overview">Overview</a> you should 
      do that now.  This section assumes you are familiar with terms defined
      in that section and know how to navigate around Misfit's windows and menus.
      </p>

      <p>
      There are also links to many tools and commands in this document.  If you
      can't figure out how to use a specific feature, follow the link to get
      more information on that feature.

      <h1>Faces</h1>

      <p>
      Faces are sets of 3 connected vertices that form a polygon.  The polygon
      is filled and may have a texture applied to it.  The polygons of the
      model can be drawn as a wireframe, a set of flat polygons, a set of
      smooth polygons, and a set of smooth textured polygons.
      When you start Misfit Model 3D for the first time, the perspective viewport will
      display textured polygons and the orthographic canvas viewports will
      display polygon wireframes with vertices.  The drawing mode for the canvas
      and perspective viewports can be changed using the <b>View</b> menu.
      </p>

      <p>
      Creating faces is generally done by selecting a creation tool and
      left-clicking in a model canvas view.  In addition to tools, some commands 
      may also create faces.
      Faces are often created in connected meshes.  In these cases the polygons will
      share vertices.  For example, the cube tool creates 12 triangular faces which
      form the 6 sides of the cube; however, it creates only 8 vertices between 
      them, rather than 36.  Keep this in mind when moving faces, since moving
      a face will likely move the vertex of one or more other adjacent faces.
      </p>

      <p>
      Use the <a href="olh_tools.html#cube">Cube</a> tool to create a cube.  After
      you have created the cube you can use the <a href="olh_tools.html#move">Move</a>,
      <a href="olh_tools.html#rotate">Rotate</a>,
      <a href="olh_tools.html#scale">Scale</a>,
      and <a href="olh_tools.html#shear">Shear</a>,
      tools to change the position, size, or shape of the cube.  
      </p>
      
      <p>Notice that if
      you create a second cube, only the vertices which are selected (in red) are
      modified by using the tools.  To change the current selection click on a 
      <a href="olh_tools.html#select">Select</a> tool. Try using
      both the Vertices and Faces selection tools.  Groups can be ignored for
      now, but will be useful later when you have a more complex model to work with.
      </p>

      <p>
      You may want to manipulate faces on one side of an object without changing the
      faces on the far side.  The easiest way to select faces on one side of an
      object is uncheck the <b>Include Back-facing</b> checkbox. Alternate you may
      Select the faces (both sides), then use a canvas view from
      another angle and right-click to unselect the faces on the far side.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <b>Select Connected</b> tool is useful for reselecting faces in a
      connected mesh.  When you select faces
      with the Select Connected tool, it recursively selects any faces that
      share an edges with newly-selected faces.  Objects like cubes,
      spheres, and cylinders can be reselected easily using this tool.
      </p>

      <p>
      In addition to using tools you can also modify the model with 
      <a href="olh_commands.html">Commands</a>.  Commands are non-interactive
      model operations.  Some are rather self-explanatory, such as 
      <a href="olh_commands.html#duplicate">Duplicate</a> and
      <a href="olh_commands.html#delete">Delete</a>.  Others require some explanation
      and are covered below.
      </p>

      <p>
      If you continue to create vertices and faces you may end up with a number
      of objects in your viewport at once.  If you need to work on a specific
      section of the model and don't want other parts to get in your way you can
      use the <a href="olh_commands.html#hide">Hide</a> command to temporarily hide
      faces.
      </p>

      <p>
      Faces are often created in connected meshes.  In some cases you may want to
      disconnect a face from the mesh it was created with.  Select the
      face in question and use the <a href="olh_commands.html#unweld">Unweld vertices</a> command.
      To rejoin the vertices, select the vertices that you want to
      join and use the <a href="olh_commands.html#weld">Weld vertices</a> command.
      Note that vertices have to be very close to each other to be welded.
      If the vertices are far apart you can use the <a href="olh_commands.html#snap">Snap Together</a> command.
      </p>

      <p>
      <a href="olh_commands.html#extrude">Extrude</a> takes faces that you have selected
      and extends them in a direction you specify.  When those faces are extended,
      each edge becomes another face which is connected to the face's original locations.
      For example if you select the front of a cube and extrude it along the
      positive Z axis two times, you will have three connected cubes which form
      one long bar along the Z axis.
      </p>

      <p>
      Some users create their models using existing images or scanned hand-drawn
      sketches as a reference. 
      You can do this by selecting the 
      <b>Set Background Image</b> option from the <b>File</b> menu.  
      Select the view direction to which
      the background should apply by clicking on the appropriate tab.
      Chose the image you want to use
      as a reference You can then use the <b>Scale Background Image</b> and 
      <b>Move Background Image</b> tools to reposition the background image.
      </p>

      <a name="group">
      <h1>Grouping</h1>

      <p>
      Faces can be organized into groups.  Grouping is required if you 
      want to apply textures to your model.  You may also want to use
      groups for the convenience of selecting a set of faces at once
      for manipulation.
      </p>

      <p>
      To create a new group, select the faces you want to group and
      open the <a href="olh_groupwin.html">Groups Window</a>.
      Use the <b>New group</b> button to create a group.  That group will appear
      in the group drop-down box at the top of the window.  While you have
      that group name in the drop-down box click the <b>Assign as group</b>
      button or the <b>Add to group</b> button.
      </p>

      <p>
      When you close the <a href="olh_groupwin.html">Groups Window</a> you can use the <b>Select Groups</b> tool
      to select this group or others in a canvas view.  Ungrouped faces
      cannot be selected while in group selection mode.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can also set a group's texture from the <a href="olh_groupwin.html">Groups Window</a>.
      Texturing is covered in the next section.
      </p>

      <a name="texture">
      <h1>Texturing</h1>

      <p>
      Once you have faces organized into one or more groups, you can apply textures
      to those groups.  To begin applying textures, open the 
      <a href="olh_texturewin.html">Materials Window</a> from the <b>Groups</b> menu.
      Use the <b>New Texture</b> button to select an image to use as a material.
      USe the <b>New Color</b> button to create a solid color material.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Important note:</b> Texture image dimensions should be a power of 2.
      In other words the height and width should be 16, 32, 64, 128 and so
      on.  The height and width do not need to be equal to each other (256x128 is
      legitimate).  MM3D should handle improperly sized textures, but other
      rendering systems may not.
      </p>

      <p>
      When you have created one or more materials you can close that
      window by selecting <b>Ok</b> and open the group window again.
      </p>

      <p>
      Open the <a href="olh_groupwin.html">Groups Window</a> again and select a group.  
      Then select
      a texture in the texture drop-down box.  This texture will now be
      applied to the specified group.  You can then select another group and
      assign a texture to it as well.
      <p>

      <p>
      The default texture coordinates
      will probably not be appropriate for your model.  
      To change how the texture is applied to your group, select a group and use the 
      <a href="olh_texturecoordwin.html">Texture Coordinates Window</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      The texture coordinate window gives you three options for starting to edit
      texture coordinates.  The first is a <b>triangle</b> mapping.  If you select
      this mode the same three texture coordinates will be applied to all faces
      in your group.
      </p>

      <p>
      The second mapping option is <b>quad</b>.  The quad option will create two triangles
      and each will be mapped to every other face in your group.
      </p>

      <p>
      The third mapping option is <b>group</b>.  The group option creates coordinates
      for each vertex in your group which you can move independently (though you
      may not be able to select individual vertices if they overlap).  When you
      select this mode you will be prompted for a direction.  This direction
      is the angle from which the vertex coordinates will be projected onto the
      texture.  From there you can modify the coordinates by moving them around
      as needed.
      </p>

      <p>
      You may also select a subset of faces from within your group and then
      open the <a href="olh_texturecoordwin.html">Texture Coordinates Window</a>.  
      This will allow you to modify the texture coordinates of specific faces 
      without altering the texture coordinates of the rest of the group's faces.
      </p>

      <p>
      More useful methods of texturing are planned for future versions.  If you
      have any specific suggestions for improving texture coordinate editing, 
      contact me and I'll see what I can do about getting those featuers in
      a future version.
      </p>

      <a name="joints">
      <h1>Joints</h1>

      <p>
      You can give your model a skeleton by creating bone joints.  Bone joints
      are primitives that you can attach vertices to.  When animating a model
      if you move or rotate a bone joint, the attached vertices will move with the
      joint.  Generally you
      only need to create bone joints if you want to use <b>Skeletal Animations</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Select the <a href="olh_tools.html#joint">Create Bone Joint</a> tool.  
      Click in a canvas view to
      create the root bone joint.  You should see a single dot appear under
      the cursor.  Click the mouse again to create a second bone joint.
      The bone joints will be connected to each other.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The first bone joint will be the <b>parent</b> of the second (<b>child</b>)
      bone joint.  The <b>child</b> joint is always connected to the nearest
      joint to its creation point.  If you want to create a joint that is
      parented by a joint other than the one closest to its creation point, 
      create the joint near the parent and then move it to the desired location.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can move, rotate, and scale bone joints just like you manipulate 
      vertices.  Use the <b>Select Bone Joints</b> tool to select bone joints
      and then use the <b>Move</b>, <b>Rotate</b>, or <b>Scale</b> tool to
      reposition the bone joints as you desire.
      </p>

      <p>
      To assign vertices to a joint, select the vertices you want to assign
      and then select <b>Joints...</b> from the <b>Primitives</b> menu.
      This will open the <a href="olh_jointwin.html">Joints Window</a>.
      Select the bone joint you want to assign the vertices to from the
      combo box, and then
      click the <b>Assign Vertices to Joint</b> button.  This button
      will connect all the selected vertices to the bone joint named in the
      combo box.
      </p>

      <p>
      If other vertices are already assigned to the same joint,
      they will be unaffected.  If the selected vertices are assigned to another
      joint, they will no longer be connected to the first joint (a vertex can
      only be assigned to one joint).
      </p>

      <p>
      If you have a joint selected when you open the <b>Joints Window</b>, that
      joint will be the joint selected in the combo box.  Knowing this, if you
      already have a joint selected you can use the <b>Select Vertices</b> tool
      and Shift-Select the vertices to add them to the current selection.
      This will allow you to skip the joint selection step in the <b>Joints Window</b>
      </p>

      You can also use the 
      <a href="olh_commands.html#assigntojoint">Assign Vertices to Bone Joint</a>
      command to assign the currently
      selected vertices to the currently selected bone joint.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      When animating a model, moving a <b>parent</b> joint will cause all the 
      <b>child</b> joints to move also (as opposed to model edit, where mode all 
      bone joints move
      and rotate independently of each other).  Attached vertices will also move
      with the bone joint.
      </p>

      <a name="animations">
      <h1>Animations</h1>

      <p>
      Animations can be <b>Skeletal</b> animations or <b>Frame</b> animations.
      <b>Frame</b> animations are animations where you specify the position
      of each vertex for each frame of the animation.
      <b>Skeletal</b> animations are animations where you attach vertices to
      bone joints and then you rotate or move bone joints.
      The vertices attached to those joints move with the joints.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Skeletal</b> animations are generally easier and quicker to work
      with.  If you need to create frame animations (for example, so that
      you can save your model in the Quake MD2 or MD3 format) it is often easier to create
      the animations as <b>skeletal</b> animations and convert them
      to <b>Frame</b> animations before you export the model to a 
      specific format.
      </p>

      <p>
      To create animations select <a href="olh_animwin.html">Start Animation Mode</a> 
      from the <b>Animations</b>
      menu.  Select either the <b>Skeletal</b> or <b>Frame</b> tab and then use the
      <b>New</b> button to create an animation.  Set the number of frames and
      frame rate (in frames-per-second).
      </p>

      <p>
      Once you have created an animation you can use the frame slider to set
      a current frame.  After setting a frame you can use the standard tools
      and commands to move the model to the position you want for the current
      frame.  How you move the model depends on the type of animation you
      want to create.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Frame</b> animations are simple to create, but can be rather tedious to
      edit.  Each vertex of a polygon must be positioned where you want it for 
      every frame of the animation.  Use the vertex or face selection tools
      to select vertices and then you can move them with the move, rotate,
      or scale tools.
      </p>

      <p>
      Note that if you have frame animations you will be unable to add or
      delete polygons.  You may only use the <b>Merge</b> function to
      add polygons to the model.  If you need to change the number of polygons
      in a model after creating frame animations, you will have to delete the
      frame animations.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      If you need frame animations (for example, if you want to create
      a quake MD2 or MD3 model), it is generally
      a better idea to create <b>Skeletal</b> animations and then convert
      them to <b>Frame</b> animations.  Any time you need to change an
      animation you can change the skeletal version and then convert it
      to a frame animation.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Skeletal</b> animations are animations where you manipulate the
      bone joints that vertices are attached to rather than manipulating
      the vertices directly.  
      </p>

      <p>
      Use the <b>Select Bone Joints</b> tool to select a bone joint and then
      use <b>Rotate</b> or <b>Move</b> to change the orientation or position
      of the joint for the current frame.  Most of the time you will want
      to use the <b>Rotate</b> tool instead of the <b>Move</b> tool.  If you
      consider the way your own skeleton moves, you will notice that your
      joints only move relative to each other as the result of a joint rotation.
      The <b>Move</b> tool is typically only useful for moving the root joint
      for an animation in which the entire model moves.
      </p>

      <p>
      Any time you move or rotate a joint it sets a <b>keyframe</b> for the
      joint.  <b>Keyframes</b> can be rotation or translation keyframes.  
      A joint can have a rotation keyframe, translation keyframe, both or
      neither for every frame of an animation.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can also set a rotation or translation keyframe by selecting the
      <b>Set Rotation Keyframe</b> and <b>Set Translation Keyframe</b>
      commands from the <b>Animation</b> menu.
      </p>

      <p>
      Unselected joints that have a keyframe for the current animation will 
      appear green.  Unselected joints without a keyframe in the current
      animation will appear blue.
      </p>

      <p>
      Joint positions and orientations are interpolated between keyframes.  This
      means that if you set a joint's rotation in frames 1 and 5 of an animation,
      frames 2 through 4 will show the joint rotating between those two keyframes
      even if you did not explicitly set the rotation for the intermediate frames.
      This also means that if the frame rate of an application is running faster
      than your animation's frame rate the joints can be interpolated between frames.
      Also note that if you set the animation to loop then keyframe interpolation
      will wrap at the beginning and end of the animation--so the model will animate
      back to its first frame during its last frame.
      </p>

      <p>
      If you want to make copies of animations, split one animation into separate
      animations, join animations together, or convert skeletal animations to
      frame animations; you can use the 
      <a href="olh_animsetwin.html">Animation Sets Window</a> to perform these operations.
      </p>

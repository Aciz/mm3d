      <h1>Vertex Details</h1>

      <h2> Overview </h2>

      <p>
      A vertex is a geometric point. A model triangle (or face) 
      is defined by the
      three vertices that are connected to form the triangle. Triangles
      may share vertices. In general vertices are created when a tool 
      is used to create triangles and deleted when all the triangles that
      use the vertex are deleted. However, it is possible to create a
      vertex independant of any triangle.

      <h2> Creating a Vertex </h2>
      
      <p>
      A vertex is created implicitly when triangles are created. Select
      any tool that creates a geometric shape (such as a cube, sphere, or
      cylinder) and it will create new vertices for the triangles that it
      creates. 
      </p>

      <p>
      You may also create a vertex without any triangles attached by
      using the Create Vertex tool.
      </p>

      <p>
      Note that a vertex that is created implicitly will be deleted implicitly
      when all the geometry that uses it is deleted. By contrast, a vertex 
      that was created with the Create Vertex tool must be explicitly selected
      and deleted by the user. To find unused vertices, see the 
      Select&nbsp;Free&nbsp;Vertices command.

      <h2> Other Vertex Details </h2>

      <p>
      If two triangles share a vertex and you want to force them to each
      have a separate vertex, you can use the Unweld&nbsp;Vertices command.
      <!-- FIXME link -->
      If you want to combine two vertices into one, use the
      Weld&nbsp;Vertices command. 
      <!-- FIXME link -->
      </p>

      <p>
      In order for weld to work, the vertices must be very close in 3D space.
      If the vertices are too far apart you can force them together
      by using the Snap&nbsp;Together command.
      <!-- FIXME link -->
      You can also enable the Snap&nbsp;To&nbsp;Vertex feature to make it
      easier to line up vertices with each other.
      </p>

      <p>
      Vertices can be attached to one or more bone joints to animate
      geometry in animation mode.

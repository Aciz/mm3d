      <p>
      The <b>RGBA Window</b> is used to change light properties for a texture.
      It is made up of four sliders and four text entry boxes for the three colors 
      (red, green, and blue) and an alpha value.
      This window is accessible from the <a href="olh_texturewin.html">Materials Window</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      The four lighting types that use the RGBA Window are:
      </p>

      <ul>
         <li> Ambient - Light reflected from no particular direction.
         <li> Diffuse - Light reflected from the primary light source.
         <li> Specular - Light reflected which brings out highlights in the material.
         <li> Emmisive - Light emmited from the material's surface.
      </ul>

      <p>
      Each color value ranges from -1.0 to 1.0.
      You can drag the slider left to decrease a color's value, or drag it right to 
      increase a color's value.  You can also change a value by typing a new
      value into the text box next to the slider.
      </p>

      to ignore any changes.

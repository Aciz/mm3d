      <h1>Shininess Window</h1>

      <p>
      The <b>Shininess Window</b> is used to change light properties for a texture.
      It is made up of a slider and a text entry box for the shininess value.
      This window is accessible from the <a href="olh_texturewin.html">Materials Window</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      The shininess property of a material ranges from 0 to 100.  A higher shininess
      value means the material is more shiny (yeah, sounds obvious--but you never
      know).
      You can drag the slider left to decrease the shininess value, or drag it right to 
      increase the shininess.  You can also change the value by typing a new
      value into the text box next to the slider.
